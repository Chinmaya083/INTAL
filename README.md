# INTAL
Creating an integer of arbitrary length, called INTAL.
I have demonstrated the creation of an integer of arbitrary size. The integer is stored as a string, with memory allocated dynamically.
Ex:- The number 1002 would be stored as "1002\0"
Operations demonstrated :- comparison, addition, multiplication, subtraction, power, fibonacci,factorial, search, min and max.
Feel free to explore more operations. :)
